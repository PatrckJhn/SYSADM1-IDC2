**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I wanted SYSADM1 to provide a basic understanding of system
  administration, thus I had higher expectations for it in terms of
  practical tools and concepts. The training exceeded my expectations by
  giving me hands-on experience with topics like administering Windows
  servers and maintaining Git repositories.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Web servers, Windows administration tools, and Git and GitHub
  repositories, Monitoring and creating our own network to fix the issue
  were, I believe, the primary subjects for me. My teamwork and
  management of versions skills were enhanced by Git and GitHub, and my
  understanding of web servers provided me with knowledge regarding
  hosting and managing internet enterprises. Windows Administrative Tools
  helped me better comprehend basic system management tasks, which
  boosted my confidence in handling real-world IT scenarios.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The practical exercise was, in my opinion, the most effective method,
  especially when it comes to managing Git repositories and setting up
  web servers. This improved my understanding and study of the subjects
  as I worked with my peers and reviewed real-world case studies.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The web server configuration and monitoring work was the most
  beneficial to me. I was able to combine a number of skills, like using
  Windows Administrative Tools and platform services and investigating
  other systems, which improved my overall proficiency as an IT student
  and allowed me to practice my knowledge in practical settings.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Troubleshooting problems with web server setups and printing services
  was one of the main challenges. I overcome this by employing
  trial-and-error techniques, reviewing internet documentation, and
  searching for peer help online. I learned from this how crucial
  perseverance and critical thought are to solving problems.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, the course promoted critical thinking by pushing us to examine
  system issues and implement fixes. For instance, determining Printing
  Services, GIthub, and other tasks we perform require you to reflect
  more on what went wrong, weigh your options, and carry out repairs, all
  of which enhanced your analytical and decision-making skills.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I developed my technical abilities in using Windows Administrative
  Tools for system administration and setting up and maintaining web
  servers and setting up our Linux . Additionally, I became more aware of
  how crucial secure authentication techniques are to maintaining system
  integrity.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I intend to apply these skills in my upcoming IT initiatives,
  particularly in the areas of server administration and Git repository
  usage. As a future IT professional, these abilities will be essential
  to my ability to contribute to technical and collaborative work.
