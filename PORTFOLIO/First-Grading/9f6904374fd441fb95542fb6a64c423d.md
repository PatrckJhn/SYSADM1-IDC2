# SYSADM1 -- Physical Infrastructure

# Instructions:  {#instructions .list-paragraph}

Answer the following questions based on Week 3 Lecture notes.

1.  Identify potential issues in physical infrastructure setups and
    propose solutions to optimize performance or reduce costs

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Issues                              Solution
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Poor Capacity Use                   Implement server virtualization and
                                      use modular data centers that can
                                      be expanded as needed.

  Power Consumption                   Employ appropriate cooling systems,
                                      energy-efficient technology, and
                                      automated technologies to maximize
                                      power management.

  High Maintenance Costs              Put failover and redundancy systems
                                      in place. Reduce downtime using
                                      cloud-based backup options.

  Scalability Limitations             Replace hardware on a regular basis
                                      and think about utilizing cloud
                                      services to lessen reliance on
                                      physical infrastructure.

  Hardware Redundancy and Downtime    Adopt a hybrid cloud architecture
                                      that combines cloud and on premise
                                      technology to provide smooth
                                      scalability.

2.  You are a project manager responsible for implementing a new
    infrastructure project, such as a smart city initiative or a digital
    transformation strategy.

A.  **What IT systems and technologies are necessary to support the
    project\'s objectives?**

> To facilitate scalability, real-time data collecting, and processing,
> I would give top priority to the project\'s use of cloud computing,
> IoT devices, and big data analytics. These innovations, combined with
> 5G networks and artificial intelligence, will guarantee that the
> infrastructure effectively achieves the project\'s goals.

B.  **How can the IT infrastructure be designed to be scalable and
    flexible?**

> I would use containers technologies like Linux and a micro services
> architecture while designing the IT infrastructure to ensure
> scalability and flexibility. Furthermore, the system can expand
> dynamically in response to demand by utilizing a hybrid cloud
> strategy.

C.  **What are the potential security risks and vulnerabilities, and how
    can they be addressed?**

> The potential risk in network attacks, IoT errors, and data leaks are
> the key security dangers. I would use multi-factor authentication,
> strong encryption, and frequent security audits to find and fix flaws
> in order to address this.

D.  **How can the IT infrastructure be integrated with existing systems
    and processes to minimize disruption?**

> In order to facilitate smooth connection between the new IT
> infrastructure and current systems, I would use adapters and
> Interfaces. The least amount of disturbance during the transition
> could be achieved by implementing the changes in stages and giving
> personnel extensive training.
